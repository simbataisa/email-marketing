**Main User Flow:**
Users log in to access the dashboard where they view campaign performance metrics. To create a new campaign, they navigate through a 4-step wizard: setting up campaign details, selecting target audiences from email lists, creating content using templates and rich editor, then reviewing and scheduling. Email lists are managed separately where users can import CSV files, create custom lists, and export data. All campaign activities are tracked with detailed analytics showing delivery status and engagement metrics.

**Campaign Creation Flow:**
Start campaign → Enter name and subject → Select email lists → Choose template → Edit content → Preview email → Send test → Review summary → Schedule or send immediately → Monitor progress

**List Management Flow:**
Access lists → Create new list or import CSV → Add/edit recipients → Export data → Manage list settings → Delete if needed
